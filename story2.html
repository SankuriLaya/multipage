    <h3>USES OF GRAPES</h3>
    <p>Green, purple, or dark blue, grapes are a fruit available in many different colors and tastes—including a cotton candy flavor. They're grown all over the world and may come with or without seeds. With so much variety, the fruit may have you wondering, "Are grapes good for you?"—and the answer is yes.In addition to being downright delicious, grapes offer several health benefits from being a source of antioxidants to keeping you hydrated. Here are seven ways your body makes the most of grapes and how you can incorporate them into meals and snacks..</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Help reduce cholesterol</h3>
    <p>Compounds found in grapes may help protect against high cholesterol levels by decreasing cholesterol absorption (10Trusted Source).In an 8-week study in 69 people with high cholesterol, eating 3 cups (500 grams) of red grapes per day helped lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. However, white grapes didn’t have the same effect (11Trusted Source).
         Additionally, diets high in resveratrol — an antioxidant in grapes — such as the Mediterranean diet have been shown to decrease cholesterol levels (12Trusted Source)..</p>
         <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
         <p>Compounds in grapes may protect against heart disease by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>High in antioxidants</h3>
    <p>Antioxidants are compounds that help repair the damage to your cells caused by free radicals — harmful molecules that cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is associated with several chronic health conditions, including diabetes, cancer, and heart disease (13Trusted Source)Grapes are rich in several powerful antioxidants. The highest concentration of antioxidants is found in the skin and seeds. However, multiple factors may affect their concentration, including grape variety, maturity, post-harvest storage, and environmental factors (14Trusted Source).
         Interestingly enough, these beneficial compounds remain present even after fermentation, which is why wine is also an antioxidant source (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).
        Some grape varieties contain a higher content of anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids that give these fruits orange, red, blue, pink, and purple colors. Human and animal studies indicate that anthocyanins may help prevent or treat brain and heart diseases (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).
        Other important antioxidants in this fruit are resveratrol and quercetin, which may protect against heart disease, high blood sugar levels, and cancer (14Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).
        Grapes also contain vitamin C, beta carotene, lutein, and ellagic acid, which are also powerful antioxidants (14Trusted Source)..</p>
        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>Grapes are rich in antioxidants, which are beneficial plant compounds that may protect against chronic health conditions.</p>
