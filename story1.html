    <h3>USES OF STRAWBEERIES</h3>
    <p>Strawberries are a favorite summer fruit. They appear in everything from yogurt to desserts and salads. They're a low-glycemic food, meaning they have little effect on blood sugar. This makes them a tasty option for people looking to control or lower their glucose levels.
    June is usually the best time to pick fresh strawberries, but they're available in supermarkets year-round. They're delicious raw or cooked in recipes ranging from sweet to savory.</p>

    <h3>Are Strawberries Berries?</h3>
    <p>This member of the rose family isn't really a fruit or a berry—strawberries are actually the enlarged receptacle of a flower. Grown in temperate climates across South America, North America, Asia, and Europe, they're one of the most popular berry fruits in the world.</p>

    <h3>Are Strawberries Good for You?</h3>
    <pr>There's a lot to love about these sweet snacks. They're lower in calories and sugar than fruits like apples or bananas, yet they're high in fiber and other key nutrients.The health benefits of strawberries are plentiful. They naturally deliver vitamins, fiber, and particularly high levels of antioxidants known as polyphenols—without any sodium, fat, or cholesterol. They are among the top 20 high-antioxidant fruits and are a good source of manganese and potassium. Just one serving—about eight berries—provides more vitamin C than an orange.
        Strawberries also have minerals such as calcium, iron, potassium, folate, and magnesium, along with antioxidants called anthocyanins. Those are healthful plant compounds that give strawberries their red color.The amount of anthocyanin goes up as the fruit ripens. That means the redder the fruit, the more antioxidants it has.</pr>

         <h3>Health Benefits of Strawberrie</h3> 
         <p>The vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in strawberries provide important health benefits. For example, strawberries are rich in vitamin C and polyphenols, antioxidant compounds that may help prevent some diseases.The antioxidant compounds found in strawberries protect cells and tissue in your body by neutralizing unstable molecules called free radicals. Too many free radicals roaming around in your body can lead to oxidative stress, an imbalance that can harm cells and tissues.
            By curbing free radicals and oxidative stress, the plant chemicals in strawberries may lower too high levels of inflammation that can hurt your immune system and contribute to several health conditions, including obesity.</p>
